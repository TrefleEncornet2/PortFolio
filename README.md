# PortFolio
My Data Scientist portfolio

Dear Reader,

This is my Data Science PortFolio github. Here you will find several projects that I've made in order to:
- Learn Data Science.
- Share my journey through Data Science to anyone interested in it. My projects combine a lot of infos gathered on many different sources.
- Show what I can do.

All of my notebook are build as tutorials, as a result, it is better for me and everyone looking at it to learn the subjects covered in the notebook, and to evaluate my knowledge.

Enjoy !
