# PortFolio
My Data Scientist portfolio

Dear Reader,

This is my Data Science PortFolio github. Here you will find several projects that I've made in order to:
- Learn Data Science.
- Share my journey through Data Science to anyone interested in it. My projects combine a lot of infos gathered on many different sources.
- Show what I can do.

All of my notebooks are build as tutorials, as a result, it is better for me and everyone looking at it to learn the subjects covered in the notebooks, and to evaluate my knowledge. 

As you go through my projects, please, keep in mind that I don't have the pretention to make perfect codes or tutorials. They certainly contain mistakes, there are certainly ways to improve them a lot. There are just the reflection of my knowledge on the subject at a specific time.

Enjoy !
